""" I'd like to make a platforming game in a metroidvania style including:
    - discrete rooms
    - non-linear map (which is to say, not just a sidescroller, a la the old Zelda games)
    - jump mechanic
    - focus on exploration rather than combat
-> Probably going to be a proof of concept (which is to say, "the mechanics are done but not the other stuff")
Main goals:
    - Make a jumping mechanic
    - Scroll between windows smoothly
Main anti-goals:
    - Keep the mechanics down. Designing too many mechanics makes a game cluttered and messy. Simple >>>
    - mechanics => art every time it can look like crap so long as it works properly.
Extension goals:
    - Figure out a way to pick up items and have them change a mechanic (jump), changing the way the game is played.
    - etc

# Inspiration taken from http://store.steampowered.com/app/70300/VVVVVV/ which is an AMAZING game i highly recommend.
